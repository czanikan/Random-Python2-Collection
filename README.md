# Random Python2 Collection
This is a collection of python 2 codes I made at my workplace. The reason I used python2 is py2.5 was the only python version what I can use in the office. I don't have access to pip, so I only used the built-in packages in all of my projects. 

## List of Codes:
* Screensaver Saver
* Snake Game
* STL visualizer

## Screensaver Saver
Simple solution to break the screensaver policy by simulating keyboard input if the mouse is idle for a while.

## Snake Game
Text based version of the old time classic game. Haha, snake in python...

## STL visualizer
Simple STL visualizer. It's can read any binary STL file. The visualization is wireframe only.
