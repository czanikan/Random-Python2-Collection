# Random Python2 Collection
This is a collection of python 2 codes I made at my workplace. The reason I used python2 is py2.5 was the only python version what I can use in the office. I don't have access to pip, so I only used the built-in packages in all of my projects. 

## List of Codes:
* Screensaver Saver
* Snake Game
* STL Renderer
* Mouse Playback
* No Need For Mouse
* Chat Server

## Screensaver Saver
Simple solution to break the screensaver policy by simulating keyboard input if the mouse is idle for a while.

## Snake Game
Text based version of the old time classic game. Haha, snake in python...

## STL Renderer
Simple STL visualizer. It's can read any binary STL file. The visualization is wireframe only.

## Mouse Playback
With this few lines of code you can easily record your mouse movement and play it back. Can be useful sometimes.

## No Need For Mouse
No Mouse? No problem. Just run this code (somehow), hold the the multiply button and you can navigate the cursor by the WASD buttons. You can also do left/right clicks with the Q/E buttons.

## Chat Server
A simple client-server chat system up to 5 people to hang out. Still in early development.
